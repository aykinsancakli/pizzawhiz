## About the Project

The **Pizza Order System** is a web-based application designed to provide a seamless pizza ordering experience. Users can browse a menu of pizzas, add items to their cart, adjust item quantities, and place orders. The system integrates a backend built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, handling order creation, management, and retrieval, while the frontend is powered by React and Redux for state management.
